About this information standard

The purpose of the Radiotherapy Data Set is to:

collect consistent and comparable data across all NHS acute trust providers of radiotherapy services and all private facilities where delivery is funded by the NHS
provide nationally comparable data to inform the planning, provision and commissioning of radiotherapy services across the NHS.

It has been a mandatory standard since April 2009 and collects information for every patient receiving treatment of:

external beam radiotherapy (teletherapy)
brachytherapy
proton therapy
radioisotope therapy (including radioiodine)
molecular radiotherapy.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales. The other key documents (Change Request, Specification and Implementation Guide) provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.

Updates

21 April 2022: The NHS Data Model and Dictionary Change Requests (DDCRs) for Version 6.0 (Amd 84/2020) have been updated in the table above.  

At the time of publication of Version 6.0, 20 July 2021, the associated DDCRs noted that the publication of SNOMED CT Refset Metadata for use with the data item RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL PROCEDURE (SNOMED CT) was yet to be confirmed (TBC). The refset metadata is now available on the National Disease Registration Service website, as part of the National Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) user guide, and the Data Dictionary has been updated to reflect this.
