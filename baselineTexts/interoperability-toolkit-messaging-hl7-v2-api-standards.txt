Overview

These API standards cover a set of HL7 V2 messaging specifications known as the Interoperability Toolkit (ITK). For example, for sending messages about the admission, discharge and transfer (ADT) of a patient.

For more details on this API standard, see the Interoperability Toolkit Core download below.

These API standards were supplemented by the Interoperability Toolkit 3 (ITK3) Messaging Distribution FHIR API standards to support newer specifications, for example Transfer of Care, which is not supported under ITK V2.

For further information, contact the ITK conformance team.
