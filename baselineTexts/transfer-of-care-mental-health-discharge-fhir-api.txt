Overview

Use this API to create and transmit documents containing Transfer of Care information supporting a mental health discharge.

An Inpatient and Day Case Discharge Summary (Mental Health) Document (also known as an ITK3 Mental Health Discharge) is an ITK3 FHIR document containing Transfer of Care information supporting a mental health adult discharge summary to a GP practice.

For example, following an apparent overdose, a patient is admitted to a psychiatric ward for evaluation and treatment which is successful. He is discharged and the consultant sends a copy of the Mental Health Discharge to his GP.

For more details see the Transfer of Care FHIR API.
