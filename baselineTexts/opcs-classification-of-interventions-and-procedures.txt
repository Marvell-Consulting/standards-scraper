About this information standard

OPCS-4 is a statistical classification for clinical coding of hospital interventions and procedures undertaken by the NHS. The classification is mandatory for use by health care providers to support various forms of data collections for secondary uses.

The Terminology and Classifications Delivery Service within NHS Digital has responsibility for the support, maintenance, development and licensing of OPCS-4 which is governed by Crown Copyright.

Details are given below of Version 4.9, which is due for implementation on 1 April 2020.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.

Update 5 December 2019: The latest release (DCB0084 Amd 18/2019) was published on 8 October 2019. Since then, the need for a small change to a supporting document has been identified and a Corrigendum has been issued. Note that there is no impact on either the published Requirements Specification or the Implementation Guidance; however an updated Summary of Changes has been published. If you have any questions about this Corrigendum, or other OPCS issues, you can contact the developers by emailing: information.standards@nhs.net.
