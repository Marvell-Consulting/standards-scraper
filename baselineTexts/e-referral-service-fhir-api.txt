Overview

Use this API to create paperless referrals from primary to secondary care with the e-Referral Service (e-RS).

As a primary care referrer, you can:

create a new e-referral
search for relevant patient services to create a shortlist
access existing e-referrals
create a triage request for the Referral Assessment Service (RAS)
upload and manage a patient letter or attachments, linking them to a referral
retrieve appointment slots and book appointments
defer a booking to a provider if an appointment slot is unavailable

As a secondary care provider, you can:

access referrals as a worklist
retrieve non-clinical information (meta-data) about the referral
retrieve attachments which are linked to a referral or triage (RAS) request
retrieve clinical information which has been provided by a referrer
accept or reject a referral request
retrieve Advice & Guidance (A&G) conversations and send responses
convert Advice & Guidance (A&G) conversations into a referral

You cannot use this API to:

get patient details – instead, use the Personal Demographic Service (PDS)

You can access the following data:

referral attachments
referral letters
appointment slots
worklists for referral requests
worklists for triage (RAS) requests
worklists for Advice and Guidance (A&G) requests
conversation histories for Advice and Guidance (A&G) requests
Access modes

This API has two access modes:

Access mode	Authentication via	Functions	Availability
Application-restricted, unattended access	Signed JWT	A004, A005, A006 and A007	Alpha
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access	CIS2	All Endpoints	Beta
Application-restricted, unattended access

This access mode has been introduced to allow a Partner application which has been registered with us and authenticated via signed JWT to interact with a subset of e-RS FHIR API endpoints in an unattended and read-only fashion. Application-restricted, unattended access should only be used when authenticating a human user (for example via smartcard) is not possible.

Writing changes (such as Create Referral) are not supported via this access mode.

Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

This access mode allows Partner applications to access e-RS FHIR API endpoints by authenticating users with NHS Care Identity Service 2 (CIS2).

This access mode must be used for writing changes (such as Create Referral).

Who can use this API

You can use this API if you are a software developer wishing to interact with the e-referrals service (e-RS) data.

To use this API:

you must have justification for doing so
you must register with the e-RS Partners Service
as an e-RS Partner, we offer you guidance and support for onboarding via the e-RS Partners Service which can be contacted via emailing nhserspartners@nhs.net
you must assure your solution before we grant access to live data
clinical safety remains your responsibility (and the responsibility of your end user organisations), as laid out in the NHS e-RS Integration API compliance approach

See the onboarding section below for more information.

API status and roadmap
Application-restricted, unattended access

This access mode is in alpha, meaning:

it is available for testing in the Alpha environment only
we might make breaking changes
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

The e-RS FHIR STU3 API is in beta when accessed using CIS2. There is also one FHIR R4 endpoint, A030 - Retrieve e-RS business functions endpoint, as part of our beta. We plan to move more endpoints into the FHIR R4 standard in the future, as part of our roadmap.

For the current e-RS roadmap see the future of the NHS e-referral service.

Service level

This API is a gold service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This API is primarily RESTful and based on FHIR global standards for health care data exchange.

Network access

This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

To use this API with NHS smartcards you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation
Application-restricted, unattended access

This access mode is application-restricted, meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.

You can only use this access mode when authenticating a human user (for example via smartcard) is not possible.

To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:

Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

This access mode is user-restricted, meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.

The end user must be:

present
a healthcare worker
strongly authenticated and authorised by NHS Care Identity Service 2 (CIS2)

To use this access mode, use one of the following security patterns:

user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation
user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation
Role and Organisation Validation

For most e-RS endpoints requests are made in the context of a specific authorised e-RS Role at a specific Organisation for the authenticated user.

The e-RS Role is supplied to the endpoint via the nhsd-ers-business-function request header.

The Organisation is supplied to the endpoint via the nhsd-ers-ods-code request header.

Suitable values for these request headers can be obtained from the Practitioner Role Bundle returned by A030 - Retrieve e-RS business functions.

On Behalf Of User

If the SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN role is used then the User ID of the Service Provider Clinician that the Admin is acting on behalf of must be supplied via the NHSD-eRS-On-Behalf-Of-User-ID header.

"On behalf of" is only supported for a Service Provider Clinician Admin (SPCA) acting on behalf of a Service Provider Clinician (SPC).

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

A006 - Retrieve attachment
GET /STU3/Binary/{attachmentLogicalID}
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve a file that is attached to a referral or advice request.

Supported security patterns
Application-restricted access
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites
Application-restricted access

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application.

Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user or application and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to have retrieved the referral via A005 - Retrieve referral request to obtain the URLs for its attachments.

Important note

A referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. For example, a referral is booked and seen in a general knee clinical assessment service (UBRN #1), and the service decides to onward refer to a more specialist knee miniscus service (UBRN #2). This would result in two UBRNs for the referral pathway in this example (but there could be more related UBRNs if onward referred multiple times).

As such, it is important that all clinical information is obtained from across all the related UBRNs referenced in A005 - Retrieve referral request. You can do this using the following endpoints:

A007 - Retrieve clinical information
A006 - Retrieve Attachment

Note: It is possible that the initial UBRN may be the only one in the referral pathway to have clinical information and/or attachments associated.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to retrieve a clinical attachment associated with a referral

So that I can assess its content and decide what further action may be needed.

Related endpoints

You can retrieve a clinical information summary for a referral using A007 - Retrieve clinical information.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A007 - Retrieve clinical information
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.generateCRI
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to generate a PDF file that summarises clinical information for a referral.

Supported security patterns
Application-restricted access
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites
Application-restricted access

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application.

Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

Important note

A referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. For example, a referral is booked and seen in a general knee clinical assessment service (UBRN #1), and the service decides to onward refer to a more specialist knee miniscus service (UBRN #2). This would result in two UBRNs for the referral pathway in this example (but there could be more related UBRNs if onward referred multiple times).

As such, it is important that all clinical information is obtained from across all the related UBRNs referenced in A005 - Retrieve referral request. You can do this using the following endpoints:

A007 - Retrieve Clinical Information
A006 - Retrieve attachment

Note: It is possible that the initial UBRN may be the only one in the referral pathway to have clinical information and/or attachments associated.

Use case

As an authenticated user or application

I need to retrieve a clinical information summary (in PDF format) associated with the referral

So that I can assess its content and decide what further action may be needed.

Related endpoints

You can retrieve clinical attachments that are associated with a referral using A006 - Retrieve attachment.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

A008 - Retrieve referral worklist
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/$ers.fetchworklist
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve available worklists of referral requests. Use A023 - Retrieve advice and guidance requests worklist to retrieve available worklists of advice and guidance requests.

Worklists provide lists of referral/advice requests that meet certain criteria, typically where a user needs to be aware of something important, or to undertake an action, in order to avoid delays to patient care.

Service provider organisations can currently access the following referral related worklists:

The 'Referrals for Review' worklist contains booked and RAS (triage) referrals that require review by the service provider organisation
The 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist contains referrals which have been 'deferred to provider' because of a lack of appointment availability (e.g. no appointment slots). The referrals need to be reviewed and if appropriate booked into a service at the service provider organisation.

There are currently no referral related worklists available for referring organisations.

Supported security patterns

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A011 - Create referral
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/$ers.createReferral
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to create a referral by choosing a shortlist of bookable services.

Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist triage services. In order to make use of triage services please use A021 - Create referral and send for triage.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to have identified a patient, for example via Personal Demographic Service (PDS).

You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using A010 - Patient service search.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to create a shortlist of bookable services

So I can initiate my patients referral pathway, allowing the patient to book into one of the shortlisted services.

Related endpoints

To allow the patient to book their appointment in their own time, you can generate a letter for the patient by using A019 - Generate patient letter. The letter summarises the current state of the referral and any steps the patient may need to follow (e.g. appointment booking instructions).

You can book an appointment for the patient by using A015 - Retrieve appointment slots and A016 - Book or defer appointment.

For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using A012 - Maintain referral letter.

You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using A005 - Retrieve referral request, A007 - Retrieve clinical information, and A006 - Retrieve attachment endpoints where necessary.

You can generate a letter for the patient, which summarises the current state of their referral and any steps the patient may need to follow, by using A019 - Generate patient letter.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

A012 - Maintain referral letter
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.maintainReferralLetter
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to manage the set of 'referral letter' attachments associated with an existing referral, including adding or removing attachments from a referral.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

All new files to be associated with a referral must be uploaded first using A020 - Upload file to document store and then linked to the referral using this endpoint.

Important information about using this endpoint

This endpoint can be used to associate attachments to a referral that has no existing referral letter attachments. In this case you must upload the file first using A020 - Upload file to document store and then associate it to the referral using this endpoint.

You can also use this endpoint to modify the set of referral letter attachments already associated with a referral. In this case, you must post all referral letter attachments you wish to be (finally) associated to the referral, including any that were already associated. In other words, this endpoint replaces the set of referral letter attachments previously associated - with those specified in your latest request. As such, it is imperative that this call references all the attachments the user wishes to keep, every time it is called.

Below are three example scenarios which clarify the behaviour of the endpoint when referral attachments are already present on the referral:

Let us consider a referral that has two referral letter attachments associated (say "A.pdf" and "B.pdf"). If you wish to add an additional attachment (say "C.pdf"), you must upload the additional attachment "C.pdf" using A020 - Upload file to document store, and then associate attachments "A.pdf", "B.pdf" and "C.pdf" via this endpoint in a single request. That is, all three attachments "A.pdf", "B.pdf" and "C.pdf" must be included in the request to A012 - Maintain referral letter.
Let us consider a different referral that has two referral letter attachments (say "D.jpg" and "E.jpg") already associated, and you wish to remove one of them. Lets consider that you wish to remove "D.jpg". To do this, you would call A012 - Maintain referral letter specifying only "E.jpg" in your request. By omitting "D.jpg" from your request, e-RS will dis-associate attachment "D.jpg" from the referral and only attachment "E.jpg" will remain associated.
Let us now consider a referral that has four referral letter attachments associated (say "L.doc", "M.doc", "N.doc" and "O.doc"), and you wish to add some more files (say "P.doc" and "Q.doc") and remove some files (say "N.doc" and "O.doc"). To do this you must upload the additional attachment(s) ("N.doc" and "O.doc") using A020 - Upload file to document store. Following that successful upload, you must then associate only all referral letter attachments the user wishes to keep (namely "L.doc", "M.doc", "P.doc" and "Q.doc") in a single request to A012 - Maintain referral letter. Attachments not included in the request (namely "N.doc" and "O.doc") will be dis-associated from the referral as a result.

As a developer or software supplier, please ensure your users are made aware or protected from this behaviour. For example, when a referring user wants to update the attachments on a referral, the user should be presented with the currently associated attachments so they can add and/or remove attachments as required.

Note: It is not permissible to remove all referral letter attachments leaving zero attachments associated. There must be at least one referral letter attachment associated.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to be able to manage referral letter attachments associated with a referral

So I can ensure the service provider has enough information to review/process the referral.

Related endpoints

Documents must be uploaded into the e-RS document store using A020 - Upload file to document store before they can be associated with a referral.

You can check to see what referral letter information has been added to a referral by using A005 - Retrieve referral request, A007 - Retrieve clinical information, and A006 - Retrieve attachment endpoints where necessary.

HTTP status: 423

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A013 - Accept referral
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.acceptReferral
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to accept a referral that is booked into your bookable service and awaiting review.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use A008 - Retrieve referral worklist to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. A013 - Accept referral can only be used for referrals booked into bookable services, and not the referrals sent into triage services.

You need to use A005 - Retrieve referral request to retrieve the details for the referral.

You need to use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

You need to use A007 - Retrieve clinical information to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

Use cases

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A014 - Reject referral
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.rejectReferral
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to reject a referral that is booked into your bookable service and awaiting review. This returns the referral to the referrer with a mandatory user comment to explain why it has been rejected.

Consider using A022 - Cancel appointment, action later instead if you wish to ask your admin team to get the patient into the most appropriate service.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use A008 - Retrieve referral worklist to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. A014 - Reject referral can only be used for referrals booked into bookable services, and not the referrals sent into triage services.

You need to use A005 - Retrieve referral request to retrieve the details for the referral.

You need to use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

You need to use A007 - Retrieve clinical information to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

You need to use A004 - Retrieve reference data to retrieve a list of rejection reason reference data codes along with their user-friendly display names. To find relevant rejection reasons, obtain reference data from APPOINTMENT-CANCELLATION-REASON and filter as follows:

appointmentBookingCancellationReasonType must be PROVIDER_REJECT
effectiveFrom must be in the past, and
effectiveTo must not be in the past
Use cases

As an authenticated user

I need to reject an inbound referral back to the referrer after its review with an explanation of why

So that the referrer can address the reason for rejection and progress the referral appropriately.

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A015 - Retrieve appointment slots
GET /STU3/Slot
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve available appointment slots for a service.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to have identified a directly bookable service that is on the current referral shortlist. You can do this by using A005 - Retrieve referral request.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to retrieve a list of available appointment slots for a service

So that I can offer them to the patient for booking.

Important note

You need to provide the 'commissioning rule organisation' when calling A015 - Retrieve appointment slots to ensure only suitable slots are returned. You can obtain the 'commissioning rule organisation' from A005 - Retrieve referral request.

Related endpoints

You can book an appointment to an available slot using A016 - Book or defer appointment.

You can defer booking to a directly bookable service using A016 - Book or defer appointment but only in the following circumstances:

when the service has no available slots
when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available
when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)
Sandbox test scenarios

You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

Scenario	Request Query Parameters	Response
Minimum slot search	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=12000, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=20, status=free, page=1	Illustrates minimum usage/parameters with concise, minimal response.
Empty slot search response	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=10000, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=20, status=free, page=1	Illustrates how a 'no slots' response appears.
Multipage slot search (page 1)	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=11000, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=5, status=free, page=1	Illustrates first page of multi-page response.
Multipage slot search (page 2)	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=11000, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=5, status=free, page=2	Illustrates second page of multi-page response.
Multipage slot search (invalid page 5)	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=11000, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=5, status=free, page=5	Illustrates error when page is outside of valid range.
Multi schedule response	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=13000, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=5, status=free, page=1	Illustrates response when there is >1 Schedule: one Schedule is for slots with no associated clinician and the other does have an associated clinician.
Slot clinician search	schedule.actor:HealthcareService=14000, schedule.actor:Practitioner=921600556514, appointmentType=ROUTINE, _count=5, status=free, page=1	Illustrates search for clinician-specific slots

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

Internal Server Error

A016 - Book or defer appointment
POST /STU3/Appointment
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to book an appointment to a service if an appointment slot is available or defer booking if no appointment slot is available.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to retrieve available appointment slots for a service using A015 - Retrieve appointment slots.

You need to use the 'Unique Booking Reference Number' (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

Important note when deferring to provider

You should only defer booking to a directly bookable service in the following circumstances:

when the service has no available slots or
when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available or
when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within the message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)
Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to either:

book an appointment to an available appointment slot for a service or
defer booking responsibility for the service to the service provider if a booking is not possible

So I can progress my patient's care at that service.

Related endpoints

You can generate a letter for the patient, summarising the current state of their referral and any steps the patient may need to follow using A019 - Generate patient letter.

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

Overview

Use this endpoint to upload a file containing clinical information to e-RS ready to be associated with a referral.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You can only upload file formats that are supported by e-RS. Currently, the supported file formats are:

File type	File extension(s)
Plain Text	.txt
HTML Text	.html, .htm
PDF	.pdf
XML Text	.xml
RTF Text	.rtf, .rtx
Basic Audio	.au

MSWORD	.doc, .docx
DICOM	.dcm

Currently, the maximum file size supported by e-RS is 5MB.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to upload a referral letter or other clinical information file to e-RS

So that I can associate the file with an existing referral.

Important notes:

This endpoint only performs the file upload. The uploaded file is not associated with a referral until the file has been associated with a referral, for example using A012 - Maintain referral letter.

The resulting URL within e-RS for the uploaded file is returned in the 'Location' header of the response.

Related endpoints

You can associate the uploaded file with a specific referral using A012 - Maintain referral letter.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

Internal Server Error

A022 - Cancel appointment, action later
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.cancelAppointmentActionLater
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to task your admin team to rebook/redirect a referral that is booked into your bookable service and awaiting review.

Note: this will also cancel the current appointment.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use A008 - Retrieve referral worklist to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. A022 - Cancel appointment, action later can only be used for referrals booked into bookable services, and not the referrals sent into triage services.

You need to use A005 - Retrieve referral request to retrieve the details for the referral.

You need to use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

You need to use A007 - Retrieve clinical information to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

If you want to include attachments with the admin task, you need to use A020 - Upload file to document store so they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

Use cases

As an authenticated user

I need to task my admin team to rebook/redirect a referral I have reviewed (whilst also cancelling the current appointment)

So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.

Important notes
The priority of the referral can be changed as part of this endpoint.
A comment must be added to explain to the administrator what is required and can include optional attachments.
The current appointment is cancelled as part of this endpoint . If the current appointment is booked to an indirectly bookable service, you must indicate whether the appointment has been cancelled on the local provider system. If indicated as not cancelled, the referral will be added to the 'Indirectly Booked Appointments to Cancel in PAS' worklist to task the admin team to do so.
When this endpoint is successfully used, an entry will be added to the service providers 'Appointments For Booking' worklist for the admin team to action the task. The provider admin team will only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional Application user interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).

HTTP status: 423

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A023 - Retrieve advice and guidance requests worklist
POST /STU3/CommunicationRequest/$ers.fetchworklist
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve available worklists of advice and guidance requests. Use A008 - Retrieve referral worklist to retrieve available worklists of referral requests.

Worklists provide lists of referral/advice requests that meet certain criteria, typically where a user needs to be aware of something important, or to undertake an action, in order to avoid delays to patient care.

Service provider organisations can retrieve the contents of their 'Advice and guidance requests' worklist using this endpoint. This worklist contains advice and guidance requests the provider has received and which need actioning.

There are currently no advice and guidance related worklists available for referring organisations.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_ADMIN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to retrieve a worklist of advice and guidance requests

So I can determine which ones I need to take further action on.

Related endpoints

Having used this endpoint to retrieve the 'Advice and Guidance Requests' worklist, entries from it can be used as follows:

Use A024 - Retrieve advice and guidance request summary to retrieve contextual summary details of the advice and guidance request
Use A025 - Retrieve advice and guidance conversation to retrieve the conversation within the advice and guidance request, including references to attachments
Use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve clinical attachments for an advice and guidance request
Use A026 - Send advice and guidance response to respond to the referrer supplying advice or requesting further information
Use A027 - Convert advice and guidance request to referral to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. This is only possible if the referrer has authorised the provider to do so

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A024 - Retrieve advice and guidance request summary
GET /STU3/CommunicationRequest/{ubrn}
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. This endpoint provides important contextual information about the advice and guidance request (e.g. the service/specialty to which advice has been requested, etc)

This does not include the actual advice and guidance conversation between the referrer and the service provider. The conversation can be retrieved via A025 - Retrieve advice and guidance conversation.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. For service provider users, you may have identified the UBRN via A023 - Retrieve advice and guidance requests worklist.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request

So I can understand all of the relevant context for the request.

Important note

The summary includes an indicator of whether the referrer has authorised the providing organisation to convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request. If authorised, A027 - Convert advice and guidance request to referral can be used to convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request.

Related endpoints

After using this endpoint, use A025 - Retrieve advice and guidance conversation to retrieve the Advice and Guidance conversation itself.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A025 - Retrieve advice and guidance conversation
GET /STU3/Communication
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve the advice and guidance conversation between the referring organisation and service providing organisation.

A 'conversation' takes the form of the messages between a referrer (seeking advice) and a provider or specialist. Messages can include attachments.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. For service provider users, you may have identified the UBRN via A023 - Retrieve advice and guidance requests worklist.

You need to use A024 - Retrieve advice and guidance request summary to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. This will importantly include the latest version of the request which must be used.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to retrieve the conversation that is present on an advice and guidance request

So that I can review the conversation and potentially contribute further to it.

Important note

The conversation returned includes links to any attachments associated with the conversation.

Related endpoints

After using this endpoint:

Use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve any attachments associated with the advice and guidance request.
(For service provider users) Use A026 - Send advice and guidance response to respond to the referrer supplying advice or requesting further information.
(For service provider users) Use A027 - Convert advice and guidance request to referral to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. This is only possible if the referrer has authorised the provider to do so.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

A027 - Convert advice and guidance request to referral
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/$ers.createFromCommunicationRequestActionLater
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to:

convert the advice and guidance request you have received into a referral, AND
create a task for the service provider admin team to select/shortlist appropriate services for the patient, AND
provide final guidance response details back to the referrer

Note: This endpoint is only allowed to be used if the referrer has authorised the provider to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use A024 - Retrieve advice and guidance request summary to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. This will include whether or not the referrer has authorised the provider to be able to convert an advice and guidance request into a referral, and thus dictate whether this endpoint can be used.

You need to use A025 - Retrieve advice and guidance conversation to retrieve the conversation within an advice and guidance request.

If you want to include attachments with the admin task and/or the response to the referrer, you need to use A020 - Upload file to document store so they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to convert an inbound advice and guidance request into a referral and task my admin team to shortlist appropriate services for the patient

So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.

Important notes

When this endpoint is successfully used, an entry will be added to the service providers Appointments For Booking worklist for the admin team to action the task. The provider admin team will currently only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional Application user interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).

Related endpoints

You can use A005 - Retrieve referral request to retrieve the details of the referral.

You can use A024 - Retrieve advice and guidance request summary to retrieve the latest summary of the advice and guidance request.

You can use A025 - Retrieve advice and guidance conversation to retrieve the latest conversation within the advice and guidance request.

You can use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve the clinical attachments for a referral/advice request.

You can use A007 - Retrieve clinical information to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for a referral.

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A028 - Record triage outcome
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.recordReviewOutcome
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to record a triage outcome for the following referrals awaiting review:

referrals sent into a triage service
referrals deferred into a directly bookable service because of appointment slot unavailability
Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use A008 - Retrieve referral worklist to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. A028 - Record triage outcome can only be used for referrals sent into triage services, and not the referrals booked into bookable services.

You need to use A008 - Retrieve referral worklist to retrieve the contents of the 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist. This provides a list of referrals that have been deferred into directly bookable services.

Referrals from this worklist may already have been reviewed or may not have any referral clinical information associated, in which case A028 - Record triage outcome cannot be used.
A028 - Record triage outcome can only be used for those referrals, on the 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist, which are pending review.
As such, you need to use A029 - Available actions for user list to determine if A028 - Record triage outcome is a permissible action.

You need to use A005 - Retrieve referral request to retrieve the details for the referral.

You need to use A006 - Retrieve attachment to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

You need to use A007 - Retrieve clinical information to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

If you want to include attachments with the triage outcome, you need to use A020 - Upload file to document store so they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

Use cases

As an authenticated user

I need to return the referral back to the referrer with some advice

So that I can progress the patient's care appropriately with the referrer.

As an authenticated user

I need to accept the referral and task my admin team to shortlist appropriate services for the patient

So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.

Important notes
The only outcomes that are supported by this endpoint are 'Return to referrer with advice' and 'Accept and refer/book later'. 'Refer/book now' is not supported.
The triage comment text is mandatory. This comment provided will be sent to:
The initial referrer when the 'Return to referrer with advice' triage outcome is chosen.
An administrator at the receiving service provider when the 'Accept and refer/book later' outcome is chosen.
The priority of the referral can be changed as part of recording the triage outcome
When this endpoint is successfully used for recording an outcome of 'Accept and refer/book later', an entry will be added to the service providers Appointments For Booking worklist for the admin team to action the task. The provider admin team will only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional Application user interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).

HTTP status: 423

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500

Internal Server Error

A029 - Available actions for user list
GET /STU3/Task
Try this API
Overview

This endpoint allows an authenticated e-RS user to check ahead of of performing an action, whether or not the action is permitted. This endpoint performs a search for available and supported actions that can be currently performed, by the the current e-RS user on a specific referral. When a permitted action is returned, the e-RS user could immediately attempt to perform a permitted action.

You SHOULD NOT cache the list of available user actions returned because this endpoint gives the current actions for the current e-RS user, for the referral in context and is therefore, transient; a future call for a different e-RS user, referral, or at a different point in time, might result in a different set of actions, leading to potential failure flows.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN
SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You should obtain a Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) before using this endpoint, as the current UBRN version is required

Use case

As an authenticated user

I want to know what actions I might currently perform on a referral prior to attempting to do so

So that I can review my options, and do not try to persist a prohibited action

Related endpoints

To retrieve pertinent details relating to a referral:

Use A005 - Retrieve referral request to retrieve the details of the referral, UBRN and UBRN version.
Below is a list of actions that could be returned by calling A029 - Available actions for user list
Use A028 - Record triage outcome to record a review outcome based on the available clinical information and attachments.
Use A016 - Book or defer appointment to Book, or if unable, Defer, an appointment to a specific service on the current shortlist.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A030 - Retrieve e-RS business functions
GET /R4/PractitionerRole
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of available e-RS roles (i.e. business functions) at each organisation where the user works.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated user

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to retrieve a list of authorised e-RS roles for organisations I work for

So I can choose the appropriate role and organisation to work under when performing tasks.

Related endpoints

You can then use the e-RS roles to perform specific tasks using other e-RS endpoints e.g. to satisfy Role and Organisation validation.

Role and Organisation Validation

The response from a successful call to A030 - Retrieve e-RS business functions represents a Practitioner Role Bundle. Each Practitioner Role represents an e-RS Role at a specific Organisation.

For most e-RS endpoints requests are made in the context of a specific authorised e-RS Role at a specific Organisation for the authenticated user. This is accomplished by setting the values of the nhsd-ers-business-function and nhsd-ers-ods-code request headers.

The e-RS Role is supplied to the endpoint via the nhsd-ers-business-function request header.

The Organisation is supplied to the endpoint via the nhsd-ers-ods-code request header.

The entry field in the response from A030 - Retrieve e-RS business functions is an array of PractitionerRole resources. An example of a PractitionerRole resource is:

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
},


Each PractitionerRole resource has a code field which is an array of codings. The authorised e-RS Roles for the authenticated user at a particilar Organisation are represented by the value fields in the https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/eRS-BusinessFunction-1 code system. The nhsd-ers-business-function request header value should be the code field value from the relevant eRS-Business-Function-1 coding in the PractitionerRole resource e.g. SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN.

Each PractitionerRole resource also has an organization field which has an identifier in the https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code code system. The nhsd-ers-ods-code request header value should be the value field value from the organization identifier in the PractitionerRole resource e.g. "R69".

A031 - Change Shortlist
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.changeShortlist
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to change the shortlist of bookable services on an existing referral.

Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist triage services. In order to make use of triage services please use A032 - Change Shortlist and Send for Triage.

A patient can request assistance at a service (e.g. a translator, transport or advocacy) when a shortlist is created within the e-RS web application, meaning that all services shortlisted would support the patient's additional requirements to attend.

The e-RS API's do not currently support patients' additional requirements so you can neither specify services that support patients' additional requirements, view existing additional requirements for a patient, nor arrange additional requirements for a patient.

If you do not know whether the patient has an existing additional requirement need and the referral may have been shortlisted within the e-RS web application, be mindful that if you chose to amend the shortlist via changing the services, you could remove this patient need.

If you are changing services to send the patient to a triage service, the triaging service will not support additional requirements but will need to consider if the patient has any additional requirements as part of their decision for future care.

You can view additional requirements on a referral via the e-RS web application.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using A010 - Patient service search.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to change the shortlist of bookable services on an existing referral

So that I can adequately manage my patients referral pathway, allowing the patient to book into an appropriate service.

Related endpoints

To allow the patient to book their appointment in their own time, you can generate a letter for the patient by using A019 - Generate patient letter. The letter summarises the current state of the referral and any steps the patient may need to follow (e.g. appointment booking instructions).

You can book an appointment for the patient by using A015 - Retrieve appointment slots and A016 - Book or defer appointment.

For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using A012 - Maintain referral letter.

You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using A005 - Retrieve referral request, A007 - Retrieve clinical information, and A006 - Retrieve attachment endpoints where necessary.

HTTP status: 423

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A032 - Change Shortlist and Send for Triage
POST /STU3/ReferralRequest/{ubrn}/$ers.changeShortlistAndSendForTriage
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to change the shortlist to a single triage service and refer the patient directly to that triage service.

Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist bookable services. In order to shortlist bookable services on an existing referral please use A031 - Change Shortlist.

A patient can request assistance at a service (e.g. a translator, transport or advocacy) when a shortlist is created within the e-RS web application, meaning that all services shortlisted would support the patient's additional requirements to attend.

The e-RS API's do not currently support patients' additional requirements so you can neither specify services that support patients' additional requirements, view existing additional requirements for a patient, nor arrange additional requirements for a patient.

If you do not know whether the patient has an existing additional requirement need and the referral may have been shortlisted within the e-RS web application, be mindful that if you chose to amend the shortlist via changing the services, you could remove this patient need.

If you are changing services to send the patient to a triage service, the triaging service will not support additional requirements but will need to consider if the patient has any additional requirements as part of their decision for future care.

You can view additional requirements on a referral via the e-RS web application.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using A010 - Patient service search.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I need to change the shortlist and refer the patient to a triage service for assessment

So that I can put the patient on the appropriate clinical pathway for the chosen service provider.

Related endpoints

For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using A012 - Maintain referral letter.

You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using A005 - Retrieve referral request, A006 - Retrieve attachment, and A007 - Retrieve clinical information endpoints where necessary.

Locked - resource is locked

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence

A033 - Retrieve Healthcare Service
GET /R4/HealthcareService/{id}
Try this API
Overview

A patient may have 0 to 20 services associated with a single referral. A service is a place where a referrer can send a patient or obtain clinical advice concerning a specific patient. Services have attributes that can be used to understand a services functionality, terms of use, and contact information. You can use this endpoint to obtain the current version and attributes of a single service.

Supported security patterns
Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
Pre-requisites

In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:

REFERRING_CLINICIAN
REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN

You need to have identified one service ID in order to use this endpoint.

Use case

As an authenticated user

I would like to be able to see current service information

So that I can trust that the service information is correct for my patient's referral

Related endpoints
You can retrieve service ID's on a referral via A005 - Retrieve referral request as long as the referral has a shortlist containing at least a single service.
You can check if a cached service has changed via [[HYPERLINK_A034]].
You can retrieve the attributes of an entire shortlist of services (1-20) via A035 - Search for Healthcare Services.

HTTP status: 429

The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time. This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application. APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application. If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits. They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for performance testing.

If you have problems with rate limits, contact us to discuss your application design and volumetrics, and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests. Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

Example:

Receive a 429 response
Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
Wait 4s, request is successful
Return to normal request cadence
HTTP status: 500
