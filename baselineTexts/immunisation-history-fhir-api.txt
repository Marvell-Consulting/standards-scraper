Get immunisation history
Overview

Use this API to access a patient’s immunisation history.

You can:

get a patient's coronavirus (COVID-19) immunisation history, based on their NHS number

You cannot currently use this API to:

get details of other types of immunisation
get the immunisation history for a specific date range

You get the following data:

immunisation event details
patient demographic details, as captured at the point of immunisation

The patient demographic details might differ from those held in the Personal Demographics Service (PDS). To get demographic details from PDS, use the Personal Demographics Service FHIR API.

Data availability, timing and quality

All immunisation records are verified to ensure the NHS number is correct before making them available via the API.

In most cases this is automatic, and the record is available within 48 hours of the immunisation event, sometimes sooner.

Where automated NHS number verification fails, we verify the NHS number manually, which can take longer.

In a very small number of cases, we are unable to verify the NHS number, and we do not make the immunisation record available at all.

Who can use this API

This API:

is only for use by patient-facing applications
is only for non-clinical use
can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. To do this, contact us.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

API status and roadmap
Status

This API is in private beta, meaning:

it's available in production but only to a limited number of connecting applications
it's more stable, but might still be subject to minor breaking changes

If you would like to be involved in our beta programme, contact us.

Roadmap

To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our interactive product backlog.

If you have any other queries, please contact us.

Service level

This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This API is RESTful.

It also conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically, it is aligned with FHIR UK Core, which is built on FHIR Release 4.

You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example /Immunization not /immunisations
array names are singular, for example entry not entries for address lines
data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an extension object

There are libraries and SDKs available to help with FHIR API integration.

Network access

This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation

This API is user-restricted, meaning an end user must be present and authenticated.

Specifically, it uses the following security pattern:

User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation

Note that:

the end user must be a patient
the calling application must strongly authenticate the end user using NHS login
the end user must have their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level
the NHS number in the request must match the NHS number in the NHS login account
Environments and testing
Environment	Base URL
Sandbox	https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/immunisation-history/FHIR/R4/
Integration test	https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/immunisation-history/FHIR/R4/
Production	Not yet available
Sandbox testing

Our sandbox environment:

is for early developer testing
only covers a limited set of scenarios
is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

Integration testing

Our integration test environment:

is for formal integration testing
includes authorisation

It also includes ready-to-use immunisation history test data.

For more details see integration testing with our RESTful APIs.

Onboarding

You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

Details to follow.

Endpoints
Get immunisation history
GET /Immunization
Try this API

Given an NHS number, get the patient's immunisation history. Also returns the patient's demographic details, as captured at the point of immunisation.

Sandbox testing

You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

Scenario	Request	Response
Immunisation history found	patient.identifier=https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|9000000009	HTTP Status 200 with immunisation data in response body
No immunisations found	patient.identifier=https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|9000000033	HTTP Status 200 with empty bundle in response body
Bad Request	patient.identifier= anything else	HTTP Status 400 Bad Request

You can try out the sandbox using the 'Try this API' feature on this page.

Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

Request
Query parameters
Name	Description
patient.identifier	

String

The patient's NHS number. Expressed as <type>|<value> where <type> must be https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number and <value> must be a valid NHS number.

Example: https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|9000000009

Required

procedure-code:below	

String

Parent SNOMED immunisation procedure code. For example, 90640007, which is the parent code for all COVID-19 vaccinations.

Example: 90640007

Required

_include	

String

Specifies other resources to be included in the response along with the immunisations. Must be Immunization:patient, which will include patient demographic details.

Example: Immunization:patient

Required
Headers
Name	Description
Authorization	

String (^Bearer\ [[:ascii:]]+$)

An OAuth 2.0 bearer token, obtained using our NHS login pattern.

Example: Bearer g1112R_ccQ1Ebbb4gtHBP1aaaNM

Required

X-Correlation-ID	

String

An optional ID which you can use to track transactions across multiple systems. It can take any value, but we recommend avoiding . characters.

Mirrored back in a response header.

Example: 11C46F5F-CDEF-4865-94B2-0EE0EDCC26DA

Response
HTTP status: 200

The request was valid, and the response contains immunisation history and associated patient details. If there are no immunisations for the given NHS number, the response bundle will be empty.

Headers
Name	Description
X-Correlation-Id	

String

The X-Correlation-ID from the request header, if supplied, mirrored back.

Example: 11C46F5F-CDEF-4865-94B2-0EE0EDCC26DA
