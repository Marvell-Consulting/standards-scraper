Community Pharmacy Standard V2.2

Community pharmacies are offering an increased range of services to support care for people in the community. It is essential that they are able to record and share vital information about a person’s care with GP practices and other services. By doing this digitally with standards, we can ensure that care professionals and citizens have timely access to relevant information, leading to better, safer and more personalised care in the community.

The Community Pharmacy Standard was originally published in 2018 to cover a range of pharmacy services including vaccine administration, emergency supply of medication, new medicine services and others. It was updated in 2021 to allow for new services that community pharmacies are either offering now or will be offering soon and to make it into a single standard for what should be recorded in the community pharmacy. It also defines the subset of information that should be sent to the GP record for each service.

What are the benefits?
Timely sharing of clinically relevant data in relation to pharmacy services undertaken to other NHS providers
Transfer of standardised coded data sets to patients’ primary care health record
A more comprehensive patient health record with the inclusion of clinically relevant outcomes from pharmacy services, which has the potential to improve medication safety and support medicines optimisation
Reduced risk of errors and administrative burden due to elimination of paper templates and transfer of information through non-direct routes into patients’ primary care health record
Improved communication methods support community pharmacy to take on a greater range of clinical services to reduce burden on other parts of the health and care system, and also ensures that the clinical contribution of community pharmacists is visible to the wider NHS
