About this information standard

Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) for Patient Identification defines how to encode the NHS approved patient identifiers into the GS1 DataMatrix barcode (a two-dimensional barcode) and covers production, verification and printing rules for the barcode.

This standard supports the accurate, timely and safer identification of NHS patients in England, by using barcodes for positive patient identification.

The standard uses ISB 0099: Patient Identifiers for Identity Bands and the GS1 System of Standards for code numbering and barcoding, which is outlined in DAPB0108: Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the Specification and Implementation Guidance Documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
