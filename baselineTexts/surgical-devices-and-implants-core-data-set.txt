About this information standard

The Surgical Devices and Implants Core Data Set (SDICDS) is a patient level, secondary uses data set which is intended to capture generic data to link patients to specific implants or devices inserted by specific clinicians at a specific location in a robust, comprehensive, nationally consistent and comparable patient-based manner.

The standard has been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care to support the Secretary of State’s strategic requirements to ensure patient safety in the use of surgical devices and implants and the equivalent requirements raised by the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review: First Do No Harm (Cumberlege Report).

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
