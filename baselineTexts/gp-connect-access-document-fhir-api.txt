Overview

Use this API to retrieve unstructured documents from a patient’s GP practice record. Unstructured documents are usually clinical documents received from various health and care settings and held by a patient's registered GP practice.

You can:

search for a patient’s documents
retrieve a document

For example, a district nurse attends a patient at home and views their hospital discharge summary held by their GP practice.

For more details, see the GP Connect specifications for developers.
