About this information standard

The scope of the standard in terms of content is for medicines only; medical devices are currently excluded. The primary purpose is to support interoperability. Therefore electronic systems that exchange or share information about medicines relating directly to a patient's care must adhere to the standard by using dm+d identifiers and descriptions when transferring information.

Note that this information standard, formerly approved by the Information Standards Board for Health and Social Care (ISB), has been assured by SCCI as suitable for publication under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. While no changes have been made to the technical content of the standard (released in 2013), the key documents below have been updated to include changes to enhance usability.
