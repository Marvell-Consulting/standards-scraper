About this information standard

The National Workforce Data Set (NWD) is a reference data standard comprising standardised definitions to facilitate the capture of nationally consistent information relating to the NHS and wider healthcare workforce. NWD data items support a variety of workforce collections and are also embedded within operational HR/workforce IT systems, including the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) and NHS Jobs.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
