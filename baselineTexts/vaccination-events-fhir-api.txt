Use this integration to publish or receive messages about changes to a patient's vaccination details, including:

new vaccinations
updated vaccination details
deleted vaccination details

This service currently covers childhood vaccinations up to the age of 19, and for direct care purposes only, in the context of Digital Child Health. If you'd like to use this API to publish or consume other vaccination types across all age groups, contact nrlnems.ls@nhs.net.

Using a publish-subscribe model, we share information about these events with healthcare workers in other organisations such as GPs, Emergency Departments and Local Authorities.

This integration uses a publish-subscribe model - the sending system publishes events to National Events Management Service (NEMS), and NEMS forwards the events to all subscribed systems via MESH.

For example, when a GP system records a vaccination, it sends an event message containing the vaccination details to NEMS. NEMS then sends the message to all healthcare workers who have subscribed to receive vaccination event messages.

Who can use this

This integration can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so.

Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. To do this, contact us. 

For details of the legal basis for sharing NEMS events, see the NEMS controller catalogue.

You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).

Related APIs

The following APIs and integrations are also related to this integration:

National Events Management Service (NEMS)  - use this to publish and subscribe to patient-centric event message
Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH) API - use this to collect events that you subscribed to
Digital Child Health - FHIR - use this to share information about a child's health between healthcare workers
Status

This integration is stable.

Service level

This integration is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This integration uses FHIR.

It uses a publish-subscribe model.

Use our National Events Management Service (NEMS) integration to subscribe to events.

Use our MESH API to collect event messages that you subscribed to.

The message payload is based on the HL7 FHIR STU3 Messaging Implementation.

Network access

This integration is available on the internet and on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation

This integration uses NEMS and MESH API which are application-restricted, meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.

You can use this pattern as follows:

unattended (end user not present), for example as part of a back end process to check NHS numbers for data flowing from one system to another
attended (end user present) - in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably authorised locally by the calling application

In particular, this integration uses TLS-MA authentication.

It also implements authorisation controls which restrict the event types that the connecting application can subscribe to or publish.

Environments and testing

This integration uses NEMS, which is available in Opentest for early development and testing.

NEMS is also available for testing purposes in:

development (DEV)
integration (INT)
deployment (DEP)

The base URLs are as follows:

Environment	Network availability	URL
OpenTest	OpenVPN	https://msg.opentest.hscic.gov.uk/
Development	HSCN	https://msg.dev.spine2.ncrs.nhs.uk/
Integration	HSCN	https://msg.int.spine2.ncrs.nhs.uk/
Integration	Internet	https://msg.intspineservices.nhs.uk/
Deployment	HSCN	https://msg.dep.spine2.ncrs.nhs.uk/
Production	HSCN	Contact us
Production	Internet	Contact us

The  base URL for the publishing and subscribing interactions are the same, but the path is different, for example:

publish in integration over HSCN:
https://msg.int.spine2.ncrs.nhs.uk/STU3/Events/1/$process-message
subscribe in integration over HSCN:
https://msg.int.spine2.ncrs.nhs.uk/STU3/Subscription
publish in integration over the internet:
https://msg.intspineservices.nhs.uk/STU3/Events/1/$process-message
subscribe in integration over the internet:
https://msg.intspineservices.nhs.uk/STU3/Subscription

There is a testing tool which allows you to simulate a provider publishing event messages. You can also simulate making changes on PDS to trigger PDS-published event messages so you can test event message consumption.

To get advice on how to begin testing, contact us.

For more details, see the NEMS onboarding guide on getting access to Opentest and the integration (INT) test environment.

Onboarding

You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this integration. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

To outline your use case and start the onboarding process for this integration, contact us.
