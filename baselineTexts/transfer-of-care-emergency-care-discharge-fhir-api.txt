Use this integration to send discharge information from an emergency care provider to a GP practice.

For example, a patient attends A&E due to abdominal pain. After diagnosis and treatment the patient is discharged by an emergency care specialist who completes and sends an Emergency Care Discharge document to the patient’s GP.

This integration uses MESH to send and receive messages. It is part of a suite of Transfer of Care message specifications.
