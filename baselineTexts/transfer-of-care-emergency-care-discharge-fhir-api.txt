Overview

Use this API to create and transmit documents containing Transfer of Care information supporting an emergency care discharge.

An Emergency Care Discharge Summary (also known as an ITK3 Emergency Care Discharge) is an ITK3 FHIR document containing Transfer of Care information supporting a discharge typically between an emergency care department and a GP practice.

For example, a patient attends A&E due to abdominal pain. After diagnosis and treatment the patient is discharged by an emergency care specialist who completes and sends an Emergency Care Discharge document to the patient’s GP.

For more details see the Transfer of Care FHIR API.
