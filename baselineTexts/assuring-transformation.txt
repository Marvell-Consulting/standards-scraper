About this information standard

Assuring Transformation is an information standard incorporating a mandatory data collection that has been developed in response to Transforming Care: A national response to Winterbourne View Hospital and Winterbourne View Review: Concordat: A Programme of Action.

This data collection supports NHS England and NHS Improvement's monitoring of the progress in moving people with learning disabilities from inpatient to community settings.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.

 

Update 30 March 2021:

The latest release of this standard (DCB2007 Amd 35/2020) was published on 23 December 2020.  Following publication, several minor typographical errors were identified in the Data Set Specification. An updated Data Set Specification (Version 1.1 dated March 2021) has been published to correct these minor issues, and is available below. Note that there is no impact on the published Requirements Specification, Implementation Guidance or Change Specification.

If you have any questions about this update, or other Assuring Transformation issues, you can contact the developers by emailing: enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk (quote Assuring Transformation in the subject line).
