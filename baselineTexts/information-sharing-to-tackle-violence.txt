About this information standard

ISTV comprises a small de-identified dataset collected by Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments and shared with local Community Safety Partnerships (CSP) on a monthly basis. The data covers all A&E attendances resulting from violent incidents, including:

time and date of the incident
time and date of arrival in A&E
specific location of the incident
primary means of assault (for example a weapon or body part used).

The standard (ISB 1594 Amd 30/2012) was approved and published by the Information Standards Board (ISB) in September 2014.

A Corrigendum, below, notes the closure of the ISTV Programme Board and the transfer of sponsorship from the Department of Health to NHS England. It will be incorporated in the next release of this information standard.

 

2 April 2019 Update:

The implementation guidance for ISB 1594: Information Sharing to Tackle Violence Minimum Dataset has been updated; while no changes have been made to the content of the standard, the implementation guidance has been updated to reflect the introduction of the Data Protection Act 2018 (GDPR) and the owning organisation's branding guidelines. A formal review and update of the information standard and implementation guidance will be undertaken shortly.
