About this information standard

The NDTMS is a well-established collection with early iterations dating back to the 1980s and has been an Information Standard since 2007.

Providers of drug and alcohol treatment submit data on a monthly basis to the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS), for the purpose of:

monitoring the effectiveness of drug and alcohol treatment services
supporting the improvement of outcomes for service users
planning and developing services that best meet local needs.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
