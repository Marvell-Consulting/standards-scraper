About this information standard

This information standard defined a set of Assessment, Discharge and Withdrawal (ADW) Notices to support compliance with the Care Act 2014. These Notices were used to support the discharge of hospital patients considered to have social care needs, and the information standard defined the minimum set of data items to be used for these Notices.

Following engagement with NHS England, Local Authorities, the Professional Record Standards Body (PRSB), suppliers and users, the NHS Digital developers of SCCI2075 agreed that no further development of the standard would occur, and that it would no longer be supported, as the product does not support current national government or NHS discharge policy, including Discharge to Assess (D2A).

The retirement of this information standard was formally approved by the Data Alliance Partnership Board (DAPB) in June 2022, and an Information Standards Notice (ISN) confirming the retirement was issued. 

The documents on this page relating to the standard are now provided for reference only.
