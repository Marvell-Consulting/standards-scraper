About me

About Me information is the most important details that a person wants to share with professionals in health and social care. This information might include how best to communicate with the person, how to help them feel at ease or details about how they like to take their medication. The PRSB has published a standard outlining how About Me information should be documented and shared in health and care records.

Latest release v1.2

The standard is now aligned with updates to the Core information standard and Urgent transfer from care home to hospital to keep consistency. Please see the detailed  , outlining the changes to this latest version.
