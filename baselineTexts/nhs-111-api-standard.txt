There is a later version of this API standard that was developed but not used, called the Integrated Urgent Care Domain Message Specification V3.0.

We recommend you do not use it.

Overview

Use this API standard for point-to-point messaging to share information between NHS 111 and other organisations, such as GPs and ambulance services, when a patient interacts with NHS 111. 

It supports the following communication types from NHS 111:

advise a healthcare facility or GP of an expected visit from a patient who has called NHS 111
advise a patient's GP when a patient is referred to another healthcare facility
advise the ambulance service that a patient requires an ambulance
query the Repeat Caller Service
API status

This API standard is stable.

Technology

This API standard uses synchronous ITK SOAP with an ITK CDA payload.
