Overview

Use this API to enable administrative and clinical end users to book and manage patient appointments held in any of the principal GP practice systems.

You can:

retrieve a patient’s appointments
search for free slots
read an appointment
book an appointment
amend an appointment
cancel an appointment

For example:

staff at a GP practice can book, view, amend or cancel appointments on behalf of a patient at another practice
staff at an urgent care NHS 111 call centre can book, view, amend or cancel appointments on behalf of a patient - at the patient’s registered GP, or federated GP practices

Note: You need to use this API in conjunction with the GP Connect Foundations FHIR API. With this API you can:

get patient details - “Read Patient”

search for patient - “Patient Search”

get practitioner details - “Read Practitioner”

search for practitioner - “Practitioner Search”

get organisation details - “Read Organisation”

search for organisation - “Organisation Search”
