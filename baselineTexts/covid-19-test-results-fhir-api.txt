Get COVID-19 test history

This API is in private beta. If you want to be involved, contact us.

Overview

Use this API to access a patient’s coronavirus (COVID-19) test results history.

You can:

get a patient's COVID-19 test history, based on their NHS number with an optional specific date range

You cannot currently use this API to:

get details of other types of test

You get the following data:

COVID-19 test event details
Data availability, timing and quality

All test records are verified to ensure the NHS number is correct before making them available via the API.

In most cases this is automatic, and the record is available within 48 hours of the test event, sometimes sooner.

In a very small number of cases, we are unable to verify the NHS number, and we do not make the test record available at all.

Who can use this API

This API:

is only for use by patient-facing applications
is only for non-clinical use
can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. To do this, contact us.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

API status and roadmap
Status

This API is in private beta, meaning:

it is available for testing use
it is available for production use after approval and adding to private beta
we might make breaking changes

If you would like to be involved in our beta programme, contact us.

Service level

This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This API is RESTful.

It also conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically, it is aligned with FHIR UK Core, which is built on FHIR Release 4.

You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example /Observation not /observation
array names are singular, for example entry not entries for address lines
data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an extension object

There are libraries and SDKs available to help with FHIR API integration.

Network access

This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation

This API is application-restricted, meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.

Specifically, it uses the following security pattern:

Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication

Note that:

the end user must be a patient
the calling application must strongly authenticate the end user using NHS login
specifically, the end user must have their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level
the calling application must pass the user's NHS login identity token in the NHSD-User-Identity header when calling the API
the NHS number in the identity token must match the NHS number for which data is being requested
Environments and testing

Sandbox testing

Our sandbox environment:

is for early developer testing
only covers a limited set of scenarios
is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

Development testing

Our development environment:

is for early development testing
includes authorisation using the NHS Sandpit

Available test NHS patients:

NHS number
9686368973
9686368906
9658218873
9658218881
Integration testing

Our integration test environment:

For more details see integration testing with our RESTful APIs.

Onboarding

You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

For further information on onboarding contact api.management@nhs.net.

Endpoints
Get COVID-19 test history
GET /Observation
Try this API

Given an NHS number, get the patient's COVID-19 test history.

Sandbox testing

You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

Scenario	Request	Response
COVID-19 test history found	patient.identifier=https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|9000000009	HTTP Status 200 with test results data in response body
No test results found	patient.identifier=https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|9000000033	HTTP Status 200 with empty bundle in response body
Bad Request	patient.identifier= anything else	HTTP Status 400 Bad Request

You can try out the sandbox using the 'Try this API' feature on this page.

Request
Query parameters
Name	Description
patient.identifier	

String

The patient's NHS number. Expressed as <type>|<value> where <type> must be https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number and <value> must be a valid NHS number.

Example: https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|9000000009

Required

code	

String

The SNOMED code related to the observation type. It support a single value or comma seperated values (e.g. 871555000,871553007) List of available codes

Example: 871553007


_include	

String
