Overview

These API standards were developed by us along with the INTEROPen community to produce an England-wide FHIR STU3 set of profiles called CareConnect, which we published in November 2018.

The specification was published as a work in progress to support discussion and evaluation but not for implementation.

The FHIR standards work is continuing as FHIR UK Core using FHIR release 4 to create a unified approach to interoperability across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This is to enable consistent information flows across borders to improve health and care outcomes for all patients.
