Use this integration to create and transmit documents containing Transfer of Care information supporting an inpatient and day case discharge.

An Inpatient and Day Case Discharge Summary Document (also known as an ITK3 eDischarge) is an ITK3 FHIR document containing Transfer of Care information supporting inpatient and day case discharges typically between an acute hospital and a GP practice.

For example, a patient attends hospital for elective hip replacement surgery and is discharged by her consultant after a couple of days. The consultant completes and sends an eDischarge document to her GP.

This integration uses MESH to send and receive messages. It is part of a suite of Transfer of Care FHIR message specifications.
