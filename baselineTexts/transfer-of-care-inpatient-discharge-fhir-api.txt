Overview

Use this API to create and transmit documents containing Transfer of Care information supporting an inpatient discharge.

An Inpatient and Day Case Discharge Summary Document (also known as an ITK3 eDischarge) is an ITK3 FHIR document containing Transfer of Care information supporting inpatient and day case discharges typically between an acute hospital and a GP practice.

For example, a patient attends hospital for elective hip replacement surgery and is discharged by her consultant after a couple of days. The consultant completes and sends an eDischarge document to her GP.

For more details see the Transfer of Care FHIR API.
