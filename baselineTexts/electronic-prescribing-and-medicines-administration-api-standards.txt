Overview

Use these API standards to share medication requests between electronic hospital patient medicines administration (ePMA) systems and hospital pharmacy or stock control systems.

In particular, they define the structure of the FHIR MedicationRequest which acts as a medication order request to the pharmacy for a given patient under care on the ward.

There is guidance for the STU3 implementation of the FHIR standard and for the FHIR UK Core (R4) standard.

For more details see Implementation guide for digital medicines.
