About this information standard

This information standard specifies both the four identifiers that must be included on NHS patient identity bands and the format for presenting them, so that identity information is clear and unambiguous to all healthcare staff. A well-designed identity band, based on this standard, reduces the risk of mis-identification, helping to ensure a patient is not given the wrong care and treatment.
