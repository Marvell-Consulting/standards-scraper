Overview

These API standards are being developed as FHIR UK Core using FHIR release 4 to create a unified approach to interoperability across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This is to enable consistent information flows across borders to improve health and care outcomes for all patients.

The specification is published as a work in progress to support discussion and evaluation but not for implementation.

This development builds on work we did with INTEROPen, HL7 UK and the FHIR community to produce an England-centric FHIR STU3 set of profiles called CareConnect which were published in November 2018.

For queries and comments please email the Interoperability Team.
