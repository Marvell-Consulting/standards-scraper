Overview

These API standards cover a set of generic FHIR messaging components we developed using FHIR STU3 running over MESH to create a unified approach to NHS message and document flows across England. 

Payloads are not specified as these components can carry any payload.

These components, along with the NHS Digital FHIR Message and FHIR Document specifications, make up the Interoperability Toolkit 3 (ITK3) solution which is accompanied by an ITK3 test harness.

The FHIR Messaging components were developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community.

For further information, contact the ITK conformance team.
