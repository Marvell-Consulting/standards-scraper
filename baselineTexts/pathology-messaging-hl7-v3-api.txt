Overview

Use this API to request laboratory tests and send the results back to the requester, usually the patient's GP or consultant. Results can also be copied to other healthcare providers for information.

One request can lead to several results reports and each report is complete in its own right. If incomplete reports are issued, a final report carries all the reported information, replacing the originals entirely.

This API is not widely adopted - it is only used as part of the NHS Newborn Blood Spot (NBS) Screening Programme which involves a limited number of pathology laboratories. Pathology Messaging - EDIFACT API supports most of the pathology interactions.

This API will be superseded by the Pathology Messaging - FHIR API.

Who can use this API

This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

Related APIs

The following APIs are also related to this API:

Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH) API - use this API to transfer messages securely across health and social care organisations

Pathology Messaging - EDIFACT API - use this API to send pathology results from pathology laboratories to the requestor, using UN/EDIFACT based messages sent over MESH

Pathology Messaging - FHIR API - use this API to request chemical pathology results from a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to NHS primary or secondary care settings.

API status

This API is stable and has been in a V1.2 draft state since 2008. 

Service level

This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This API is an HL7 V3 API and uses asynchronous interactions, using HL7 V3 ebXML messaging.

For more details, see HL7 V3.

Message Handling System (MHS) adaptor

To remove the complexity of building your own Message Handling System, we offer a pre-assured, client side MHS adaptor that you can integrate into your own infrastructure.

It makes it easier to connect to the NHS Spine and perform business operations by exposing a RESTful API that conforms to the HL7 V3 standard. 

Network Access

You need a Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) connection to use this API.

For more details, see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation
Authentication

This API is user-restricted, meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

The end user must be:

a healthcare worker

strongly authenticated using an NHS smartcard

For more details see user-restricted APIs.

Authorisation

For some activities, the end user must be authorised to perform that activity.

The API itself does not perform any authorisation checks. Rather, the calling system is expected to perform them. The authorisation rules are specified in our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database.

For more details see our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database on the registration authorities and smartcards page.

Environments and testing

In order to perform end-to-end testing with the MHS Adaptor, you will require access to NHS Digital’s Path to Live environments.

Onboarding

You must get your software onboarded before it can go live.

As part of onboarding, this API uses the Common Assurance Process (CAP), which is tailored for each NHS service. For more details, contact us.

Interactions

For a full list of interactions for this API, see the Laboratory section in the Spine Message Implementation Manual (MIM).
