Overview

Use this API to access details of systems registered in the Spine Directory Service (SDS).

You can:

get accredited system details

You cannot currently use this API to:

search for organisations
search for people
Accredited system records

Every system that connects to the Spine has one or more “Accredited System” (AS) records in SDS, identified by an Accredited System Identifier (ASID). This ASID is unique to a system deployed in a specific organisation, so the same application deployed into three NHS organisations would typically be represented as three unique ASIDs.

MHS records and endpoints

Every GP Connect system also has one or more “MHS” records (or message handling server record), identified by Party Key and Interaction ID. MHS records of GP Connect provider systems contain the endpoint of the target practice, as defined by the FHIR service root URL. Please see System topologies for more details on the allocation of ASIDs and Party Keys.

For all intermediary messaging endpoint lookups, this API returns the NHS Digital Spine MHS endpoint address.
Who can use this API

This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

API status and roadmap

This API is in private beta, meaning:

the API is available in our sandbox and integration test environments
the API is available for production use (to use this API please contact niasupport@nhs.net)
we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we'll give advance notice

To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our interactive product backlog.

If you have any other queries, please contact us.

Service level

This API is a bronze service during private beta, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays. (The planned production service level will be platinum.)

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This API is RESTful.

It also conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange.Specifically, it is aligned with FHIR UK Core, which is built on FHIR Release 4. You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

resource names are capitalised and singular, for example /Endpoint not /endpoints

Errors handling in this API follows NHS guidelines and produces an OperationOutcome FHIR resource response with appropriate HTTP code

Network access

This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and Authorisation

This API uses the Application-restricted pattern.

In this pattern, you authenticate your application by including an API key with each API request. The API key is unique to your application.

For more details, including detailed technical integration instructions, see Security and Authorisation - Application-restricted RESTful APIs - API key authentication page within the NHS Digital Portal.

Environments and testing
Environment	Base URL
Sandbox	https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/spine-directory/FHIR/R4
Integration test	https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/spine-directory/FHIR/R4
Production	https://api.service.nhs.uk/spine-directory/FHIR/R4
Sandbox testing

Our sandbox environment:

is for early developer testing
only covers a limited set of scenarios
is open-access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

Integration testing

Our integration test environment:

is for formal integration testing.
includes application authentication

This API does not have a standard test data pack as it will be dependant on the service you are trying to access, for more details see Spine Services and Interaction IDs and integration testing with our RESTful APIs.

Onboarding

You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

There is no separate onboarding process for the SDS FHIR API. Onboarding will be dictated by the current processes of the API that consumes the SDS FHIR API, for example GP Connect. Once approval has been granted to use the API that utilises the SDS FHIR API then production access can be granted. To request production access please contact api.management@nhs.net.
