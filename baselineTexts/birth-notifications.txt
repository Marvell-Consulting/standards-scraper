About this information standard

The NHS Number for Babies (NN4B) service has been decommissioned and functionality replaced by an equivalent service provided by the NHS Digital Personal Demographics Service (PDS).

The PDS Birth Notification Data Sets enables all NN4B-compliant systems to send or receive birth notification communications directly to and from the Personal Demographics Service. The standard sets out the systems compliance required by maternity and child health systems for this purpose.
