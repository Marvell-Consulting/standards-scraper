About this information standard

Since May 2014, all NHS trusts in England which deliver systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) are required to provide comprehensive monthly usage data to Public Health England. These data include information on all anti-cancer drugs given to adult and paediatric patients with solid or haematological malignancies.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
