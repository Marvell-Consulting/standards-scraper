This API is not available in production. If you are developing a new integration, consider using the Pathology Messaging - EDIFACT API. For details see, API status.

Overview

Use this API to share pathology results from a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to the requestor, typically a healthcare worker in NHS primary or secondary care.

Initially it focuses on haematology and clinical biochemistry test reporting - also known as chemical pathology.

It is intended to replace the current Pathology Messaging - EDIFACT API and supersedes Laboratory HL7 V3 (see the Message Implementation Manual under Domains -> Health and Clinical Management -> Laboratory).

Who can use this API

This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

Related APIs

The following APIs are also related to this API:

Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH) API - use this API to transfer messages securely across health and social care organisations

Pathology Messaging - HL7 V3 API - use this API to request NHS Newborn Blood Spot (NBS) laboratory tests and send the results back to the requester, using our client side MHS adaptor that you can integrate into your own infrastructure

Pathology Messaging - EDIFACT API - use this API to send pathology results from pathology laboratories to the requestor, using UN/EDIFACT based messages sent over MESH

Additionally, use the following API standard to implement this API:

Interoperability Toolkit 3 Messaging Distribution FHIR API standards - use this API standard to implement a set of generic messaging components using HL7 FHIR STU3 to create a unified approach to NHS message and document flows across England

API status

This API is experimental - an early pre-alpha version under development.

Service level

This API uses MESH which is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This is an asynchronous messaging API. The messages take the form of FHIR STU3 messages sent via MESH.

For more details, see FHIR and MESH.

Network access

You can access this API via:

the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)

the internet

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation

This API uses MESH which is an application-restricted API.

The API does not perform any end user authentication or authorisation checks. Rather, the calling system is expected to perform them. The authorisation rules are specified in our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database.

For more details see our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database on the registration authorities and smartcards page.

Environments and testing

This API uses MESH.

As a developer, you are most likely to want to connect to MESH using either the MESH client or the MESH API.

For more details about using the MESH client, see MESH client.

For the MESH API, there are several independent, externally accessible instances of MESH you can use for testing. For full details, see MESH API - Environments and testing.

Onboarding

This API is not available for onboarding yet.
