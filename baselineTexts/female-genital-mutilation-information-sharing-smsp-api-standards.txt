Overview

Become a Spine Mini Service Provider giving access to female genital mutilation (FGM) information for children under 18 to relevant NHS professionals across England, using our Female Genital Mutilation - Information Sharing (FGM-IS) SMSP API standards.

Your commercially available Spine Mini Service Providers (SMSP) product will give access to FGM-IS for your SMSP clients. We will list your SMSP provider service along with other conforming software products in our Conformance Catalogue.

Before you begin any development work using these API standards, contact us to discuss your best options.

Note your SMSP clients can only:

query a patient's FGM status

In addition to SMSP provider software assurance, we also need to assure your SMSP clients.

For more details, see Introduction to the FGM Information Sharing Service.

Who can use this API

These API standards can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below). 

Related APIs

The following APIs are related to these API standards:

Personal Demographics Service - FHIR API - use this to find the correct NHS number for a given patient
Female Genital Mutilation - Information Sharing - FHIR API - use this for the full features of our FHIR API
API status

These API standards are in beta.

Technology

These API standards are based on our FGM - IS - FHIR API but with a simplified read-only model.

Specifically, they are based on the HL7 FHIR DSTU2 1.0.1 Messaging Implementation.

For more details, see FHIR.

Network access

You need a Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) connection to use these API standards.

For more details, see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation

These API standards are application-restricted, meaning the calling application is authenticated but the end user is either not authenticated or not present.

In particular, these API standards use TLS-MA authentication.

For more details on authentication, see application-restricted APIs.

Even though these API standards do not technically require the end user to be authenticated, a condition of onboarding is that the calling application must:

authenticate the end user locally
use local role-based access controls to authorise the end user
Environments and testing

You can test these API standards using our Path to Live environments.

Onboarding

You must get your software onboarded before it can go live.

As part of onboarding, these API standards use a slightly scaled down version of the Common Assurance Process (CAP) which involves a Target Operating Model (TOM) form for the transfer of risk. 

Note that in addition to SMSP provider software assurance, for clinical safety reasons, we also need to assure your SMSP clients.

For more details, and to get a copy of the latest TOM forms to complete, contact the interoperability conformance team on itkconformance@nhs.net.
