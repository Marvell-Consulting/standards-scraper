Information provided by local authorities in shared care records

Improving information sharing between health and social care is critical to professionals who care for people and the health and wellbeing of people themselves. The Information provided by local authorities in shared care records are the important details that the local authority holds about people that would be useful for health and care professionals in providing care and support in hospital, at home or in a care home.

Latest release v1.1

This information standard is now aligned with updates to the Core information standard and Urgent transfer from care home to hospital to keep consistency.Â

This information standard is part of a wider set of standards, published in November 2020.
