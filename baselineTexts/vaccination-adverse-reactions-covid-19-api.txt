Overview

Use this API to provide information to us at NHS Digital on adverse reactions.

You can send us information on adverse reactions relating to: 

coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations.

This API specifies the flow of information relating to vaccination-related adverse reactions from any healthcare setting including:

hospital hubs - NHS providers vaccinating on site 

local vaccine services – community or primary care led services which could include primary care facilities, retail, community facilities, temporary structures or roving teams 

vaccination centres – large sites such as sports and conference venues set up for high volumes of people 

This API consists of pipe-delimited files to send us over MESH.

For FHIR standards relating to the flow of information directly back to the patient's GP, see Digital Medicine - FHIR API.

Regulatory reporting

This information flow captures any adverse reactions which occur within the first fifteen minutes after administration of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination. 

At NHS Digital, we must share this information with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme. This scheme is the UK system for collecting and monitoring information on suspected safety concerns or incidents involving medicines and medical devices, including vaccines. 

The information we share with MHRA as part of this scheme is anonymised.

This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development, by contacting us.
