About this information standard

This standard provides the specification for use of the NHS Number by NHS bodies and by other organisations providing health and care services in England in partnership with the NHS. It defines how the NHS Number must be used in identifying people receiving health and care services, and in locating and communicating their health and care records and other information pertaining to the planning and provision of their care. The standard sets out how information systems must accept, store, process, display and transmit the NHS Number, and what organisations must do to ensure that they use the NHS Number correctly.
