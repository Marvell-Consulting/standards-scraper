Care homes view of shared care records

Improving information sharing between health and social care is critical to professionals who care for people and the health and wellbeing of people themselves. The care homes view is the information that care home staff should see in a shared care record.

Latest release v1.1

The standard is now aligned with updates to the Core information standard and Urgent transfer from care home to hospital to keep consistency. Please see the detailed V1.1 Release notes, outlining the changes to this latest version.
