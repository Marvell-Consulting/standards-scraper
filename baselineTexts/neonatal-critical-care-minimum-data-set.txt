About this information standard

The Neonatal Critical Care Minimum Data Set (NCCMDS) provides a record of what happens to a patient when they receive neonatal critical care in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Maternity Ward or Neonatal Transitional Care Ward.Â 

The primary purpose of the NCCMDS is to allow the operation of the National Tariff Payment System (NTPS) within neonatal critical care. It supports the NTPS by specifying and facilitating the capture of data needed to generate a Neonatal Critical Care Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) for each calendar day (or part thereof) of a period of neonatal critical care.

This information standard is maintained by the National Casemix Office within NHS Digital. It is related to SCCI0076 Paediatric Critical Care Minimum Data Set, in that it shares common fields and values, including an agreed list of Critical Care Activity Codes.

An Information Standards Notice (see release table below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the Specification and Implementation Documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
