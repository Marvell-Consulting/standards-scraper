Overview

Use this API to submit 111 or 999 call triage data to us for quality monitoring purposes, following an NHS Pathways patient phone assessment.

As a 111 and 999 telephony provider's host system developer, you must submit triage data to us in real time following an NHS Pathways patient phone assessment. This is to comply with the Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) requirement of the Pathways licence agreement.

Providers and their regional commissioning groups can also log in to view this data using the Intelligent Data Tool (IDT) dashboard.

Because of the dashboard name, this API is sometimes referred to as the Intelligent Data Tool (IDT) web service.
