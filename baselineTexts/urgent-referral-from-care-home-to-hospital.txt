Urgent transfer from care home to hospital

Improving information sharing between health and social care is critical to professionals who care for people and the health and wellbeing of people themselves.  The urgent transfer from care home to hospital standard is the information required for the care and support of a person when they are admitted to hospital from a care home in an emergency.

Latest release v1.2

The standard is now aligned with updates to the Core information standard to keep consistency. Please see the detailed V1.2 Release notes, outlining the changes to this latest version.

Sharing information across health and social care

This information standard is part of a wider set of standards, published in November 2020. PRSB was asked by NHS Digital to help to create national standards for sharing information between health and social care, drawing on the learning from successful local projects to speed up national roll out and adoption.
