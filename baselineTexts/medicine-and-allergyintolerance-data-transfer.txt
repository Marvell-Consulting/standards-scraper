About this information standard

NHSX has commissioned NHS Digital to produce an Information Standard which puts in place definitions that are to be used when a health professional sends or receives patient medication and allergy/intolerance information, by computer system, between care locations.

The purpose is to ensure that medication and allergy information is transferred between systems and locations in a machine-readable format. This will be achieved by:

● transferring medication information using the newest UK version of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource), using either ‘Medication Codable Concept’ or ‘Medication Resource’ as is most appropriate to the use case

● usage of dose syntax to transfer the amount of medication per dose as a simple coded quantity

● transferring allergy/intolerance information using SNOMED CT and dm+d codes.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the requirements specification provides further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
