Overview

Use this API to create and transmit documents containing Transfer of Care information following an outpatient consultation in a clinic.

An Outpatient Clinic Letter (also known as an ITK3 Outpatient Letter) is an ITK3 FHIR document containing Transfer of Care information from the hospital to the patient's GP and other relevant parties following a consultation in a clinic.

For example, a patient suffering from double vision is referred to an eye hospital and subsequently attends their outpatient appointment. Investigations indicate hypertropia, and the ophthalmologist recommends glasses fitted with prisms for treatment. The ophthalmologist completes and sends an Outpatient Clinic Letter to her GP.

For more details see the Transfer of Care FHIR API.
