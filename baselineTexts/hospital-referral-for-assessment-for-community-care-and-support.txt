Hospital referral for assessment for community care and support

Hospitals must determine when it is safe to discharge a person and implement a discharge plan. Part of that decision-making process requires hospital staff to determine whether the person needs to be referred for an assessment to establish ongoing care and support in the community after discharge.

The Hospital referral for assessment for community care and support is the information required when a person is referred for ongoing community assessment after a hospital stay.

Latest release v1.1

This standard is now aligned with updates to the Core information standard and Urgent transfer from care home to hospital to keep consistency. Please see the detailed V1.1 Release notes, outlining the changes to this latest version.
