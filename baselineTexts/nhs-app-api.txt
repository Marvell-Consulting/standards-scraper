Overview

Use this API to engage with users of the NHS App - a simple and secure way for patients registered with a GP surgery in England to access a range of services on their smartphone or tablet.

You can:

send in-app messages to specific users of the NHS App
send native Apple or Android push notifications to mobile devices registered by specific users of the NHS App
Who can use this API

To use this API, you must integrate with the NHS App.

Contact us before you begin any development work with this API, even if your service is already integrated.

API status and roadmap

This API is in private beta, meaning:

we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we'll give advance notice
we cannot guarantee availability or performance

To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our interactive product backlog.

If you have any queries, please contact us.

Service level

This API is a silver plus service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays. However, we respond to severity 1 and severity 2 incidents outside of business hours.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

This API:

is RESTful
conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange
aligns with FHIR UK Core (which is built on FHIR Release 4)
Specific rules for FHIR APIs

FHIR APIs are RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

resource names are capitalised and singular, for example /CommunicationRequest not /communicationRequests

array names are singular, for example recipient not recipients for communication recipients

data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an extension object

There are libraries and SDKs available to help with FHIR integration.

Network access

This API is available on the internet, and, indirectly, on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Authorisation

This API is application-restricted, meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user. In particular, the three FHIR CommunicationRequest endpoints use signed JWT authentication - you authenticate your application by sending a signed JSON web token (JWT) to our OAuth 2.0 authorisation server. For more details see Application-restricted RESTful APIs - signed JWT authentication.

After following these steps to create an application and register the public key, the App ID should be provided to the NHS App onboarding team to grant your application permissions to the features that are appropriate to your use cases. If this step is not completed, all calls to this API will return responses with status code 403 Forbidden.

Environments and testing
API Environment	NHS Login Environment	Base URL
Development	Sandpit	https://dev.api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-app/
Integration Testing	Integration (AOS)	https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-app/
Production	Production	https://api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-app/
Development

Our development environment:

includes authorisation
is for initial development and integration testing
points to the Onboarding Sandpit NHS App environment, which in turn is using the NHS Login Sandpit environment

We have created a Postman collection during internal development and testing of the API, which you may find useful when working with this environment.

Developers working with C# may also be interested in the integration tests that we have developed for the API, which make use of the fire.ly .NET SDK.

Integration testing

Our integration test environment:

includes authorisation
is for formal release testing and assurance when onboarding with NHS Login
points to the Onboarding AOS NHS App environment, which in turn is using the NHS Login Integration (AOS) environment

For more details see integration testing with our RESTful APIs.

Onboarding

You need to get your product or service approved by us before you can use this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so itâ€™s worth planning well ahead.

Services not yet integrated

If your service is not yet integrated with the NHS App, you will need to follow our step by step process to onboard with us.

Integrated services

If your service is already integrated, and you now want to add notifications and messaging to your integration, you will need to take some extra steps before you can use this API. Explore notifications and messaging in the NHS App for guidelines and restrictions, and the documents you will need to complete.

To onboard for this API, please get in touch with the NHS App onboarding team at app.onboarding@nhs.net.

Endpoints: Communication
Send an in-app message
POST /communication/in-app/FHIR/R4/CommunicationRequest
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to send an in-app message to one or more NHS App users.

Recipients are specified by NHS number. A single request to this endpoint can send an identical message to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS numbers. In-app messages will only be sent to users who have had their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level.

We support a subset of Markdown for describing the body text of in-app messages. The length of each in-app message is limited to 5000 characters, including any markdown characters and embedded hyperlinks.

The body of requests made to this endpoint are instances of HL7 FHIR R4 CommunicationRequest resources. This schema documentation describes which fields on that resource we require and support. The API is tolerant of (but will silently ignore) any additionally supplied optional fields. For example, we do not currently honour the doNotPerform or priority fields.

object
	

Communication request to send a in-app message



resourceType
string
required
	

FHIR Resource Type - this must be CommunicationRequest.



identifier
array
	

An optional array of identifiers used to identify this request for later analysis.

We have defined the following two systems for identifiers that will be stored with the request:

Campaign ID - denoted by system https://fhir.nhs.uk/NHSApp/campaign-id . This is an optional campaign identifier, used for later identification of a group of multiple communication requests. For example, this could be used to identify all messages that pertain to invitations for a particular vaccination programme.
Request Reference - denoted by system https://fhir.nhs.uk/NHSApp/request-id . This is an optional request identifier, used for later identification of a specific request.

Note that these identifier system names are case-sensitive. The values provided for each of these two identifiers are limited to 50 characters, and must not match the regular expression <(.|\n)*?>. No more than one campaign ID and one request reference can be supplied with each request.

The API will not reject requests that contain other identifier systems, but these values will be ignored and not recorded against the request.

When a CommunicationRequest resource is returned in the response body to a successful request, this array will also include a globally unique identifier assigned by the API, with the system urn:ietf:rfc:3986. This is the same logical ID contained within the Location header of the successful response.



status
string
required
	

Request Status of the message. This must always be active (case-sensitive).

Default: active


payload
array
required
	

The body text of the message to be displayed in the NHS App



sender
object
required
	

The sender of the in-app message.



recipient
array
required
	

An array of NHS numbers corresponding to the patient(s) to whom this in-app message should be sent. Each communication may be sent to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS numbers. The communication request will be rejected if any duplicated values exist in this array.

Send an in-app message and push notification
POST /communication/in-app-with-notification/FHIR/R4/CommunicationRequest
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to send an in-app message followed by an associated native Apple or Android push notification to one or more NHS App users.

Push notifications will not be sent to users between the hours of 10pm and 6am UK time. If a valid request to send an in-app message with an associated push notification is processed between these hours, the in-app message will be delivered immediately, and the push notification will be scheduled for delivery at 6am.

Recipients are specified by NHS number. A single request to this endpoint can send an identical message and push notification to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS numbers. In-app messages and push notifications will only be sent to users who have had their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level.

If a recipient is an active NHS App user but has not registered a device to receive native push notifications, they will still receive the in-app message.

This endpoint allows you to specify the content that will appear in the in-app message. It does not allow you to specify the content that will appear in the associated push notification. By default the content of the associated push notification will read "NHS App. You have a new message.". To discuss changing this standard push notification content for your application, contact the NHS App team.

We are considering making an enhancement to allow the sender name of the in-app message content to be dynamically included in the content of the associated push notification. This may be of benefit if your application sends communications on behalf of several NHS organisations. You can track, comment, and vote for this feature on our interactive product backlog.

When a recipient taps the native notification, the NHS App will open on the in-app messaging inbox page.

We support a subset of Markdown for describing the body text of in-app messages. The length of each in-app message is limited to 5000 characters, including any markdown characters and embedded hyperlinks.

The body of requests made to this endpoint are instances of HL7 FHIR R4 CommunicationRequest resources. This schema documentation describes which fields on that resource we require and support.

Send a push notification
POST /communication/notification/FHIR/R4/CommunicationRequest
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to send a native Apple or Android push notifications to mobile devices registered by specific users of the NHS App.

Push notifications will not be sent to users between the hours of 10pm and 6am UK time. If a valid request to send a push notification is processed between these hours, the push notification will be scheduled for delivery at 6am.

Recipients are specified by NHS number. A single request to this endpoint can send an identical push notification to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS numbers. Push notifications will only be sent to users who have had their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level.

The body text of notifications can be up to 200 characters in length.

They must not contain

personally identifiable information (for example:the name of a user's doctor)
sensitive information (for example:details about a health condition)
links to external websites

You can also optionally specify a URL for a page within the NHS App to be opened when the recipient taps on the push notification. If a URL is not specified, the NHS App will open on the home page.

The body of requests made to this endpoint are instances of HL7 FHIR R4 CommunicationRequest resources. This schema documentation describes which fields on that resource we require and support. The API is tolerant of (but will silently ignore) any additionally supplied optional fields. For example, we do not currently honour the doNotPerform or priority fields.

Communication request for sending a push notification



resourceType
string
required
	

FHIR Resource Type - this must be CommunicationRequest.



identifier
array
	

An optional array of identifiers used to identify this request for later analysis.

We have defined the following two systems for identifiers that will be stored with the request:

Campaign ID - denoted by system https://fhir.nhs.uk/NHSApp/campaign-id . This is an optional campaign identifier, used for later identification of a group of multiple communication requests. For example, this could be used to identify all messages that pertain to invitations for a particular vaccination programme.
Request Reference - denoted by system https://fhir.nhs.uk/NHSApp/request-id . This is an optional request identifier, used for later identification of a specific request.

Note that these identifier system names are case-sensitive. The values provided for each of these two identifiers are limited to 50 characters, and must not match the regular expression <(.|\n)*?>. No more than one campaign ID and one request reference can be supplied with each request.

The API will not reject requests that contain other identifier systems, but these values will be ignored and not recorded against the request.

When a CommunicationRequest resource is returned in the response body to a successful request, this array will also include a globally unique identifier assigned by the API, with the system urn:ietf:rfc:3986. This is the same logical ID contained within the Location header of the successful response.



status
string
required
	

Request Status of the message. This must always be active (case-sensitive).

Default: active


payload
array
required
	

The body text to be displayed in the push notification.



recipient
array
required
	

An array of NHS numbers corresponding to the patient(s) to whom this push notification should be sent. Each communication may be sent to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS numbers. The communication request will be rejected if any duplicated values exist in this array.

Max items: 100
Min items: 1
Response
HTTP status: 201

Request successfully received by the server and queued for sending to recipients.

Get a daily communication event report
GET /communication/report/events
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to get a daily report of events relating to in-app messages and push notifications that you have previously sent to NHS App users.

An event will be included in this report detailing the outcome of attempting to send each communication to each individual recipient, for each channel (push notification or in-app message). Additionally, for in-app messages only, an event will be included in this report if and when the recipient reads the message.

The information provided by this endpoint is generated by a daily batch process. Note that events in the report may pertain to communication requests that were submitted on earlier days.

Pagination

To avoid returning excessively large response bodies, the results may be split across multiple pages. On retrieving the response for the first page of results, the Link header should be inspected to determine whether any additional pages of results exist. If so, these can be retrieved by making additional request(s) with the optional page parameter specified.

Get details of NHS App users
GET /communication/report/patients
Try this API
Overview

Use this endpoint to get details of patients registered with the NHS App for a given GP surgery, and an indication of whether they have enabled push notifications on one or more devices. The response will only include patients who have had their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level.

Client applications must only invoke this endpoint as agreed with the NHS App team, typically to retrieve details of patients at GP practices where their service is available.

This information can be used by client applications to determine whether it is appropriate to attempt to use the NHS App API to send in-app messages and push notifications to patients, or if alternative communication channels should be used instead.

The information provided by this endpoint is generated by a daily batch process. Client applications should cache and refresh local copies of this data accordingly.

Pagination

To avoid returning excessively large response bodies, the results may be split across multiple pages. On retrieving the response for the first page of results, the Link header should be inspected to determine whether any additional pages of results exist. If so, these can be retrieved by making additional request(s) with the optional page parameter specified.
