About this information standard

The Maternity Services Data Set (MSDS) sets out requirements for the collection and submission of operational and clinical data relating to each stage of the maternity care pathway. The data will be used, locally and nationally, to support commissioning, payment, planning, outcomes monitoring and addressing health inequalities. Version 2.0 of the standard is a significant change and brings the MSDS into line with the structures of other national data sets managed by NHS Digital.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
