About this information standard

The FGM-IS is a national IT system that supports the ongoing safeguarding of patients, under the age of 18, who have a family history of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).

This information standard makes provision for the data held within the FGM-IS to be made available to all relevant healthcare staff by allowing integration of a view only capability of the family history indicator within all applicable IT systems across all health care services. 

This standard was formerly known as 'FGM Risk Indication System (FGM RIS) Local System Integration'; the release published on 6 March 2020 (Amd 28/2019) introduced a new name for the standard to reflect a change in clinical practice. 

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
