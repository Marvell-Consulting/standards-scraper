Overview

Use this API to send a PDF consultation summary to a registered GP practice - using GP Connect Messaging.

You can:

create messages to send using MESH
use the HL7 FHIR STU3 interoperability standard to define the message structure
include FHIR messaging information as defined by the ITK3 message distribution standard v2.5.0

For example, to send a document containing a patient's consultation notes to their GP practice when a patient is seen:

at another GP practice than their own
by an out of hours service
by a district nurse at home

Each message sent using this API uses the GP Connect Messaging components, MESH, and ITK3, to deliver the message.

Each message sent is a FHIR Message, defined as a FHIR composition, constructed to meet the ITK3 standard with a specific payload structure.

For more details, see the GP Connect specifications for developers.
