Overview

Use this API to view a patient's registered GP practice record, with read-only access.

You can:

view a patient’s primary care record by requesting sections or headings
define a date range to filter larger sections
incorporate these views directly into Electronic Patient Record systems

For example:

GP practices can view all of the patient’s primary care records even when they are held on a different GP system
care settings such as NHS111, Physio, Community, Emergency, or Social Care can view the records held by the patient’s GP practice to better inform any care decisions they make for a patient

For more details, see the GP Connect specifications for developers.
