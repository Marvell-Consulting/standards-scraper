About this information standard

NHS Continuing Healthcare (NHS CHC) means a package of ongoing care that is arranged and funded solely by the NHS where the individual has been assessed and found to have a ‘primary health need’ as set out in the National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing in England.

This new standard, the NHS Continuing Healthcare (NHS CHC) Patient-Level Data Set, sets out the rules for an end to end, patient level data set that captures data relating to patient details, NHS CHC eligibility, activity, reviews and care packages.

The existing NHS CHC quarterly collection of aggregate data (DCB2117) will continue to be submitted by providers as normal until the quality of data submitted in DCB3085 reaches an adequate level to allow the quarterly collection to be retired.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
