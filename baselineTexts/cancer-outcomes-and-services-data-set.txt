The Cancer Outcomes and Services Data set (COSD) provides the national standard for reporting activity to support implementation and monitoring of Improving Outcomes: a Strategy for Cancer (IOSC).

These changes should be implemented by 1 April 2020, with full conformance required by 1 July 2020.

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
