About these information standards

These information standards support the implementation of NHS England and NHS Improvement's Patient Costing Transformation programme which is intended to deliver:

better benchmarking of costs and patient pathways, enabling a reduction in unwarranted variation
better understanding of patient pathways, supporting the introduction of more effective care models
an improvement in accuracy of the national tariff and local prices, helping to strengthen efficiency incentives.

The information standards mandate providers of acute, ambulance, mental health, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and community services within England to submit patient-level activity and financial data to NHS Digital, acting on behalf of NHS England and NHS Improvement.

For the 2021-2022 financial year, 2 standards have been approved:

DAPB4001 Ambulance
DAPB4000 Integrated
covering acute, mental health, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and community services.

These information standards are published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.  An Information Standards Notice for each standard (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standards.

In the event of issues or questions about any of these standards, please contact the developers at NHS England and NHS Improvement: costing@england.nhs.uk
