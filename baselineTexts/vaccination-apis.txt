Overview

Use these APIs to provide vaccination information to us at NHS Digital.

You can send us information relating to:

coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations
COVID-19 extended data attributes
COVID-19 hourly vaccination aggregate data for the NHS Foundry
seasonal flu 2021-22 vaccinations
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations

These APIs specify the flow of vaccination-related information from healthcare settings including:

hospital hubs - NHS providers vaccinating on site 

local vaccine services – community or primary care led services which could include primary care facilities, retail, community facilities, temporary structures or roving teams 

vaccination centres – large sites such as sports and conference venues set up for high volumes of people 

These APIs consist of delimited files sent to us over MESH.

For more details on how to interact with end users to collect COVID-19 information safely, see the functional specifications under 'Additional guidance'.

For FHIR standards relating to the flow of information directly back to the patient's GP, see Digital Medicine - FHIR API.

For FHIR standards relating to the flow of information to other care providers such as Child Health, see Vaccination Events - FHIR API.

Who can use this API

These APIs can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development, by contacting us.

You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

API status

These APIs are stable.

Service level

This API uses MESH which is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.

For more details, see service levels.

Technology

These APIs consist of delimited files you send to us over MESH.

Some are pipe-delimited, others are not-sign-delimited files. For details, see the individual specification.

Network access

These APIs are available on the internet and on the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN).

For more details see Network access for APIs.

Security and authorisation

These APIs use MESH which is an application-restricted API.

These APIs do not perform any end user authentication or authorisation checks. Rather, the calling system is expected to perform them. 

Environments and testing

These APIs use MESH.

As a developer, you are most likely to want to connect to MESH using either the MESH client or the MESH API.

For more details about using the MESH client, see MESH client.

For the MESH API, there are several independent, externally accessible instances of MESH you can use for testing. For full details, see MESH API - Environments and testing.

Onboarding

You must get your software onboarded before it can go live.
