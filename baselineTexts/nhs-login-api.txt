Overview

Use this API to enable patients and the public to access multiple digital health and social care services with NHS login, a single re-usable login.

You benefit from:

using a trusted and secured identity platform
choosing a proper level of end user verification
displaying a brand name the public recognises
meeting the Identity Verification and Authentication Standard (DCB3051)

This API uses OpenID Connect 1.0 which is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
