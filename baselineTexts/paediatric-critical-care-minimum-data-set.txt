About this information standard

The Paediatric Critical Care Minimum Data Set (PCCMDS) provides a record of what happens to a patient when they receive paediatric critical care in a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or other critical care setting suitable for children. Version 1.0 of the PCCMDS was introduced in April 2007.

The primary purpose of the PCCMDS is to allow the operation of the National Tariff Payment System (NTPS) within paediatric critical care. It supports the NTPS by specifying and facilitating the capture of data needed to generate a Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) for each calendar day (or part thereof) of a period of paediatric critical care.

This information standard is maintained by the National Casemix Office within NHS Digital. It is related to SCCI0075 Neonatal Critical Care Minimum Data Set, in that it shares common fields and values, including an agreed list of Critical Care Activity Codes.

An Information Standards Notice (see release table below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the Specification and Implementation Documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
